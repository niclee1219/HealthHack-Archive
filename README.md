# HealthHack-Archive (HealthHack 2024)
Streamlining Airflow for Hospitals

## Project Description

ARCHIVE is a pioneering web application designed to revolutionize the way hospitals manage their Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Leveraging the power of IoT sensors and predictive analytics, ARCHIVE aims to enable healthcare facilities to reduce their energy consumption by up to 20%. This initiative not only contributes to lowering Scope 2 Carbon Emissions, which are emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the hospital, but also enhances operational efficiency through advanced, user-friendly features. At its core, ARCHIVE offers a comprehensive dashboard that provides users with detailed insights into their HVAC systems' performance and energy usage, ensuring optimal airflow and environmental conditions within hospital settings.

### Key Features:

- **Energy Optimization:** Intelligent analysis and adjustment of HVAC operations to minimize energy consumption while maintaining optimal indoor conditions.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Utilization of time series forecasting for predicting future energy expenditure and regression models for anomaly detection, facilitating preventive maintenance.
- **Intuitive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface that offers real-time insights into HVAC performance, energy savings, and maintenance alerts.

### Built With:

- **Retool:** For building the dashboard and user interface efficiently.
- **SQL:** To manage and query the extensive data collected from IoT sensors.
- **JavaScript (JS):** For creating interactive and dynamic web application features.

## Project Roadmap

Currently, ARCHIVE is in its early stages of development. Our immediate focus is on building on the predictive analytics algorithms and enhancing the dashboard's functionality. Moving forward, we aim to:

- **Expand the Team:** Onboard more developers and engineers, especially those with expertise in hardware components, to enrich our product development capabilities.
- **Improve Predictive Algorithms:** Continuously refine our algorithms for time series forecasting and regression modeling to ensure higher accuracy in predictions and anomaly detection.
- **Pilot Testing:** Collaborate with pilot hospital wards to test and validate our effectiveness in reducing energy consumption and improving operational efficiency.
- **Feedback Incorporation:** Use insights and feedback from pilot testing to further improve the web application.
