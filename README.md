## Project Description

ARCHIVE is a pioneering web application designed to revolutionize the way hospitals manage their Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. By harnessing the capabilities of IoT sensors and predictive analytics, ARCHIVE seeks to empower healthcare facilities in curbing their energy consumption. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency observed in hive structures, ARCHIVE employs dynamic adjustments to HVAC settings based on occupancy levels, predicted temperatures, and prevailing weather conditions, promising a potential reduction in energy usage of up to 20%.  This initiative not only contributes to lowering Scope 2 Carbon Emissions, which are emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the hospital, but also enhances operational efficiency through advanced, user-friendly features. At its core, ARCHIVE offers a comprehensive dashboard that provides users with detailed insights into their HVAC systems' performance and energy usage, ensuring optimal airflow and environmental conditions. Crucially, ARCHIVE achieves this seamlessly by integrating existing hardware infrastructure from these hospitals into our web application platform, rendering it a cost-effective and adaptable solution.

## Models

### Time Series Forecasting
The time series forecast model offers a straightforward, time-based forecast, enabling long-term energy planning. The goal was to accurately forecast energy usage based on historical data, taking into account both trends and seasonality patterns.

- Next steps:
    - **Model Refinement:** Continuously refine the model to improve forecast accuracy and reliability. We plan to incorporate additional factors such as real-time weather data to enhance the model's precision in forecasting energy usage. Additionally, we aim to explore the use of more advanced time series forecasting models such as ARIMA and Prophet to further improve forecast accuracy.
    - **Incorporate Real-time Data:** Integrate real-time weather data to enhance the model's precision in forecasting energy usage.

### Regression Model
The regression model's multi-factor approach provides actionable insights for real-time optimization, targeting the most significant factors influencing energy consumption. The model is designed to detect anomalies in energy usage, enabling preventive maintenance and energy-saving strategies.
